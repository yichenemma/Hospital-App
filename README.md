#Healthcare App database usage directions:

#Place the directory of the record.db database file in each of the database file connection, table creation, and other query snippets of code.

#This Healthcare App aims to simplify the medical care process with some specific features implemented to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients using the app are expected to have an account, which can be created using their E-Mail address. The App will require some basic information from the new registering patients including their name, date of birth, phone number and their medical conditions. Then an account for the patient will be created and stored in the database.

#When the patient wants to consult with a healthcare professional about their symptoms, they will be lining up virtually, and a virtual appointment will be made firstly. The virtual appointment aims to serve as a pre-consult and to establish the booking of an in person appointment. In addition, the recommendation of the clinic or hospital will be provided to the patient based on the available treatment and the distance. The pre-diagnosis and the description of the symptoms can be stored as notes into the patient's account for future reference.This process allows hospitals and clinics to get control of the number of patients in the hospital during an epidemic. However patients have the choice to select the emergency service with extra service fee, which will consider these patients in higher priority during the virtual appointment process.

#In the home page,  the patient can select their available time slot for the virtual appointment and which hospital or clinic they are considering going to. Then the patient is able to book an in-person appointment if necessary with the healthcare professionals during the virtual meeting. Patients can also manage their bill payment through their preferred banks and view their medical records at the homepage. After every consultation, the notes will be stored as medical records in the patientâ€™s account.
